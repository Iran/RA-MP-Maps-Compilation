STALINGRAD(64x126) Temperate
By Avi Vyshetsky

	This map is 4 player, 2 vs 2 teams. Two players start on 
	the top and two on the bottom. There is a lot of ore and 
	gems on this map so it would be easy to create giant 
	armies. There also a lot of mountains on this map so 
	it would be pretty easy to defend your base, but hard to
	get it your opponents base.
						
					
	Enjoy the map and send any comments to vdimitri@best.com
