Caribbean Rage
  By General Rage of the CCC

  
    Level summary:
   
        2 Player, Island to Island Combat. No bridges. This means that you 
        need to pack up your units into transports and ship them to the 
        enemy! Or pound the hell out of their base with Cruisers! There is
        plenty of cash but when its gone... its gone.. Each side has a bay
        that makes it easy to protect your shipyard and docked ships. each 
        player starts right next to their bay.

  
                                             Enjoy!
