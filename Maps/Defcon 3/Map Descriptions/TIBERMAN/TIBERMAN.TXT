This is my first map! Hope you like it! It is made for 2-7 players.
The level is 96x96, and there should be plenty of minerals and gems to harvest.

Two players start on the island at the bottom of the map, and has a good supply of resources.
These players are isolated from the mainland by a large river.
If they wish to attack, a navy is a neccessity.
The other players can use their navies to attack the isolated
players with cruisers.
I hope this works as well as I wanted it to. :)
Let me know!
Enjoy!

PS, do not use the 8th color , i think it's orange, while playing this map, or you will get a base not where it's supposed to be.
It's weird, but the editor gives you the 8 flags to use but if you don't use one (red for example) then any player that picks that color will get a base at a random location.
