Notes: Quite an interesting level. It looks like your normal double-mirrored
        board, but the interesting twists are "the trench", a long path that
        links the north and south, going through the center of the map, and
        the twin "diamond forests" which have to be seen to be believed.
        Whichever player grabs control of the diamond forest on their side
        of the map will become the dominant player on that side of the map,
        hence the name of the level (suffice it to say you have to blast your
        way into the dia forest, and if you don't have the firepower to hold
        it, you've just created a weak spot in your base instead of
        strengthening it).

        The level almost has a War2 feel to it because you have to blast
        through the trees. It was (obviously) designed for 4 players, but
        it plays completely different (and not at all less enjoyable) with
        2 players. This board also works quite well with the inital starting
        units set to 0. It is easliy defensable early in the game, no more
        early game ending strikes of 15 medium or heavy tanks.

        Finally, this board has more money than anyone will know what to do
        with. According to the RA map editor, it has nearly 2 million credits
        worth of ore and gems. That's nearly 25,000 minigunners. 250
        minigunners is an extremely large ammount, 2,500 is nearly
        unimaginable, and this board can fund 25,000. hehe.
