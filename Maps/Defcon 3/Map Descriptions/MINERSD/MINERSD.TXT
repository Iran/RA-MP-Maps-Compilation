Designed for: 8 player multi
Description:  This level contains enough ore to last for a long battle
              (A total of 2,000,005 credits.) It is built like a
              tic-tac-toe board with most of the gold and jewels in the
              middle.  This level can be played with less people but it
              dosen't work as well.  I have played this map with one other
              human and 3 computer players it worked well.
Known Bugs:   It seems the computer gets jamed up with only having two
              entrances to their base.  The 4 corners are at a dissadvantage
              because they have to go through another "square" to be able to
              access the ore in the middle of the map.  Makes for a more
              interesting battle.
Note:         If you destroy the bridges around you it is gone for good.  May
              do you good for the shortrun but it will hurt you in the end.
              E-Mail Westwood and ask them nicely to include repairable
              bridges in the next RA patch at VirtualTed@westwood.com or
              Pat@westwood.com I think it was a mistake to leave this out.
              And i'm allways open to sugestions on my next map so E-Mail me
              If you have any ideas/Requests death threats whatever!
              And thanks for usin my map!
