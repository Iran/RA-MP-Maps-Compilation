NAME: QUARTERSRA

AUTHOR: AARON MILLIS (amillis@marsweb.com)

NUMBER OF PLAYERS: 4

TOTAL $ ON MAP:  $2,300,000

REVIEW: This map is based on the great C&C multiplayer map, Quarters. 
There are 4 blocks of land in each corner of the map, all connected by
land on the sides of the map, and by bridges connecting the blocks. It
is very even, with enough gold and gems and water access for all. The way
me and my friends usually play is with a 30min buildup, but this map works 
great with or without a buildup. Another reason that it's only for 4
players (besides the name) is Westwood's sloppy LAN networking code.
Please mail Westwood and tell them that you'd like it to be fixed! Well,
I'm off to battle.
