	A level designed to use all the weapons a player has.  I'm not
sure about the ore level so if there isnt enough just E-mail me.  This
level has a lot of land so the soviets can use plenty of tank power but
the only way in to some bases is a bridge so the allies have an advantage.
There is enough water for the Allies to use cruisers and such so the 
power balance should be equal.  Any comments?  E-mail at antley@bellsouth.net
I would like comments so as I can improve my map making skills.  Enjoy
