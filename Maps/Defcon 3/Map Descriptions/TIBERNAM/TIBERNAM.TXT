Map Name:TiberNAM
Map Maker:Captain of the CCC, Tiberman
Map Size:126x64
Number of Players:8
Description:
Vietnam, Mekong River flows through the map spliting
it in half. The top four players and bottom four 
are pretty well defended, and this map should be good
for 4 on 4 play. Combined transport assaults against
one enemy at a time should work. The sooner the assault
is made, the more ore will  be captured at the enemy's
base! Get moving, soldier!
Have fun!
Put this map on yer page as long as you give credit
