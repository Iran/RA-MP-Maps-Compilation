This is a good level for two to four players.  Hints...build
several refineries (packed w/ore).  Each quadrant has a
beach that is accesible from the rest by the outside (strong
naval forces will help).

Feel free to distribute this map in its original form.

I welcome any comments, or suggestions that might make it a 
little bit better.
