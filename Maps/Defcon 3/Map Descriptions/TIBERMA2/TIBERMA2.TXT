Players: 8
Size: 96x96
Description:A great big map with four main landmasses. Two long, 
thin bridge-type connectors that lead to a large island in the center,
 that holds the main supply of harvesting materials. Capure it and you'll
 probably think you've won!
But wait! Suddenly yer base is under attack! "From where?" you ask.
From that little inconspicuous beachhead by each base! That's right! 
An early navy holds the key to control of this game! A must for Allies 
if you wanna pummel yer opponents harvs are the cruisers! Get those
transports loaded up with yer troops and attack his base!
get to work! :)
Feel free to use this map on yer map pages, just give me the credit! :)
Use it as a basis for yer own map, too, if you'd like!
Latez!
