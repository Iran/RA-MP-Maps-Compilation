Description:  Basiclly it's a water level with a bunch of islands
connected by land bridges.  I believe there is plenty of ore but
I may be wrong.  This mission should be able to bring out the best
of both worlds with lots of land for the soviets tanks and lots of 
water for allies navy.  If you have any comments e-mail me at
antley@bellsouth.net  This is my first RA map so comments are welcome.
