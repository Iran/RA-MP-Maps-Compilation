Jewels and Fools... v1.01
By Willy Nunn (tanis@wpi.edu)
Large winter map

Jewels... because there's more money to this map then you could possibly imagine.

Fools.... because with all this money, the fool who can't use proper base building/
unit building combinations is a dead man/woman

Basically the map consists of four large gem fields, and eight walled in base placement
areas (with only one exit and entrance). Perfect for those people who are tired of losing
because they weren't close enough to the money (i.e. the emphasis becomes strategy, not
luck of placement.
