Description:A really neat map! NO, really, it 
should be pretty cool. I made it out of boredom. It
has 8 starting spots all in heavily defendable positions.
The objective should be to conquer the center position.
This is a stronghold that is in the middle of the map.
One person starts there, and the others hafta try to 
kick him off. :)
Please d not use this map as a building start for your
maps.
