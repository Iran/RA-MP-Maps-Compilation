Note: 
This map is designed for up to 4 players.  All the players
should either choose from the first four colors or the second
four colors to make sure the starting positions are correct.

Briefing:
Your mission is to secure the four natural fortresses by 
eliminate all your enemies. Those fortresses have narrow
entrance and are almost impregnable.

Spoiler:
This mission is designed to be fair to both allied and soviet
players. The soviets have far better defence and offence,
but that is offset by the allies' use of a combination of
chronosphere, cruisers and transports in the back door.
